# Deployment Guide for Sanjida A. Portfolio

## ✅ Application Status
- **Backend**: Express.js server running on port 5000
- **Frontend**: React with Vite (served by Express)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **Contact Form**: Fully functional with validation
- **API Endpoints**: All working correctly

## 🚀 Deployment Options

### Option 1: Replit Deployment (Recommended)
1. In your Replit project, click the "Deploy" button
2. Select "Autoscale Deployment" 
3. Configure domain and scaling settings
4. Your app will be available at `https://your-app-name.replit.app`

### Option 2: GitHub Pages + Backend Service
1. Deploy frontend to GitHub Pages
2. Deploy backend to services like Railway, Render, or Vercel
3. Update frontend API endpoints to point to your backend service

### Option 3: Full-Stack Hosting
Deploy the complete application to platforms like:
- **Vercel** (supports full-stack Node.js apps)
- **Railway** (PostgreSQL + Node.js)
- **Render** (free tier available)
- **DigitalOcean App Platform**

## 📋 Environment Variables Required

For any deployment, you'll need:
```
DATABASE_URL=your_postgresql_connection_string
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=5000 (or your preferred port)
```

## 🔧 Production Build Commands

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build the application
npm run build

# Start production server
npm start
```

## 🛠️ Database Setup for Production

1. **Create Production Database**:
   - Use your hosting provider's PostgreSQL service
   - Or use external services like Neon, Supabase, or PlanetScale

2. **Run Database Migrations**:
   ```bash
   npm run db:push
   ```

3. **Verify Database Connection**:
   ```bash
   # Test connection
   curl -X POST https://your-app-url.com/api/contact \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"name":"Test","email":"test@example.com","subject":"Test","message":"Testing contact form"}'
   ```

## 📊 Performance Optimizations

- **Frontend**: Vite builds are already optimized
- **Backend**: Express server is configured for production
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with connection pooling
- **Assets**: Static files served efficiently

## 🔒 Security Considerations

- Environment variables are properly configured
- Database credentials are secured
- CORS is configured for production
- Input validation is implemented with Zod

## 📈 Monitoring and Maintenance

After deployment:
1. Monitor application logs
2. Set up database backups
3. Monitor performance metrics
4. Update dependencies regularly
